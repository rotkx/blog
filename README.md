# 📚 Rotkx Blog Posts Repository

Welcome to the content archive of [https://blog.rotkx.net](https://blog.rotkx.net)  
This repository holds the **original source** of all blog articles — open, transparent, and version-controlled.

<br>

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📝 Store blog post content in Markdown (`README.md`)
- 🖼️ Include related media (multiple resolutions per post)
- 📅 Organize posts by **year/month/day**
- 🔗 Match each folder name to the post slug used in the blog URL
- 🤝 Enable community contributions directly through GitHub
<br>

## 📂 Folder Structure
    /posts
      └── 2025/
        └── 07/
          └── 30/
            └── how-to-use-cookies-in-blogger/
                └── README.md # Full article content

> ✅ Each folder = one blog post. The folder name matches the post’s URL slug.
<br>

## ✍️ How to Contribute

We welcome edits, typo fixes, suggestions, or even full article drafts!

1. Open the folder for that post
2. Edit the `README.md` and propose a Pull Request
3. Optionally submit new image sizes or updates
<br>

## 🌐 Blog Integration

- Posts are **not rendered directly** from GitHub.
- After approval, they are manually **published on** [https://blog.rotkx.net](https://blog.rotkx.net).
- Media (images, etc.) are **served via GitHub CDN** using the raw URL.
- Blog post URLs match folder structure exactly.
<br>

## 🔗 Example Mapping

**Blog URL:**  
`https://blog.rotkx.net` + `/2020/06/turbo-responsive-blogger-theme.html`

**Repo Path:**  
`https://github.com/rotkx` + `/blog/2020/06/turbo-responsive-blogger-theme/README.md`
